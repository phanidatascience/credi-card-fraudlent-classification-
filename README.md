# credi-card-fraudlent-classification :
- credit card is a product for  many banks . the bank need to  find  the  correct customer   and avoid fraudlent  to prevent from fraud  customers 
- the acuuracy must be high to avoid the fraudlent  as on which basis the banking provides  credit card  to customers 
- In our dataset we considered the class  which is dependent on different features /variables  and give the customer is  good customer or fraudlent 
- the good customer is denoted by 0 and the  fraudlent  record class  is denoted by 1 
- we use cnn algorithm  for  the classification  of two classes 
- even we got 99 percentage  of accuracy   testing  dataset and training data set  we cant go with it  we need to consider confusion matrix and  classification report to find out other  values with  may  descibes the model and  data set  results
- even  implementing  cnn algorithm we got  true negative  value high   which effects  higher on the  identifying of  fraudlent  class customer 
- so we  considered  smote  over sampling method to reduce the true negative value  and increase the classification  accuracy  of true positve and true negative values
